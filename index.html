<p>
Our affinity diagram describes hurdles, constants, pricing, advertising, and features included in our problem. These things give us a better overview of what it will take to come up with a solution to the problem and incorporate all of these things.

<p>
My persona is a theoretical professor who would benefit from the app named Jim Robbins. He lacks technological skills and wants more student involvement.

<p>
My storyboard pictures my persona Jim Robbins as a professor in one of his classes teaching an 8am class with students who are not early risers and are only there because they have to be due to the low amount of class openings. The next frame pictures the theoretical new application that a student would be able to use in order to pick their classes and have more options and features avaialble to them. The next frame pictures the new class in the next semester being more attentive and participating because they are people who willingly chose this timeslot and to be in his class. The final frame shows that this would in theory impove grades because class participation would lead to better understanding and in turn better grades.
